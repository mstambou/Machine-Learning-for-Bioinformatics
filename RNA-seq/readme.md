## RNA-seq Data
In this lab we are going to be introduced to gene expression data obtaine by RNA-seq, using next generation sequencing techniques. In this particular case the data is obtianed by Illumina HiSeq 2500 machine. This will produce [paired end reads](https://www.illumina.com/science/technology/next-generation-sequencing/paired-end-vs-single-read-sequencing.html). 
Here we are extracting gene expression data for Escherichia coli str. K-12 species. There are in total 6 sequencing [samples](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=Escherichia+coli+str.+K-12+RNA+seq), but for now we are only going to extract 3 of them. You can extract the raw reads in [fastq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format) format by going to the [EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/) website and simply pasting the sample accession numbers there. For todays experiment we're extracting sequence data with the following accessions:
* SRR8309842
* SRR8309843
* SRR8309844

The typical steps taken to obtain these raw reads RNA-seq data are:
1) deciding on library types, sequencing depth, number of replicates etc.
2) Extracting the RNA seqs, preparing libraries.
These processes generate short reads in fastq format, such as the ones that we are going to deal with today. 
Following these steps comes data preparation and analysis, which we will be going through today. These steps include:
1) quality control: seeing if the reads are of high quality and postprocessing them if needed (trimming etc)
2) mapping the reads to a reference sequence (in our case, or to contigs in other cases), using some maping tool
3) quantification of abundance of these genes.
4) differential expression analysis.

The most common way of presenting raw reads is in Fastq format. Below is an example of one read:
```
@SRR8309842.1 1/1
NTAATACTGGCTGTGAGTGCGTTGGTACTGACGTTGTGGGGAAGCGATAAAATCGTTGCTACCGGCGTGGCGATTATCTGGGGGCTAACTTTTGCATTGGTTCCCGTCGGCTGGTCAACGTGGATCACCCGCTCGCTGGCCGATCAGGCA

```
Each read is composed of four lines. The first line begins with the @ symbol, which indicates the header of that read. Second line is the raw sequecne letters. Line three begins with a '+' sign, and the fourth line is the quality of the read presented in line 2. The values of these characters indicating read quality from low to high is as follows:
```
!"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~
```

### Quality Control of your data
FastQC is a popular tool to perform quality assessment. As a general rule, read quality decreases towards the 3â€™ end of reads, and if it becomes too low, bases should be removed to improve mappability. Otherwise we will end up having ambiguous reads and later will create problems when we try to map these reads back to a reference genome, and we will be uncertain whether or not these maps are due to error or are actual biological signal.
Lest first check the quality of the reads we downloaded using [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/)
to get FastQC please go to this [link](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/fastqc_v0.11.8.zip) or issue a wget command in your shell
```
wget https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/fastqc_v0.11.8.zip
```
and then update your ~/.bashrc file to locate the FastQC executables. i.e.:
```
export PATH="/home/mstambou/FastQC/:$PATH"
```
we can use two methods to generate fastqc reports over the fastq reads, the interactive way or through comamnd line. Let's use command line to check the quality of our reads. We can issue a command i.e.:
```
fastqc SRR8309844/SRR8309844_2.fastq.gz -t 10 -d fastqc_reports/
```
to generate an html formatted report. A good tutorial to understand the different compomnents of the report and how to analyze results would be [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz93ReOv87Y)
